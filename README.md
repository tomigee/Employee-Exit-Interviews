# Employee-Exit-Interviews
In this project, we examine commonalities between employees that recently resigned from institutes within the Department of Education in Australia. We're provided with two datasets containing information surrounding employee exits: the first dataset is from the DETE (Department of Education, Training and Employment), and the second is from the TAFE (Technical and Further Education) Institute in Queensland, Australia. The aim of this analysis is to answer the following questions:
1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
